# Cache Line Extractor
For Chromium-based applications you can directly extract the cache line configurations here.

Usage: `./main <path-to-binary> <config.json>`

To get the keystroke mappings for Chrome use the `cache_line_extractor`.

Run the program like this:

`./main /opt/google/chrome/chrome  ../cache_line_extractor/config_chrome_demo.json`
